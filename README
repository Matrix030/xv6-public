xv6 - OS HW#3
This project contains modifications to the xv6 operating system to implement various scheduling, priority management, and concurrency mechanisms as required for an 'Introduction to Operating Systems' course.

Setup and Build
To clean previous builds and compile the xv6 system, run:

make clean && make && make qemu-nox
This command will build and launch the xv6 system in QEMU without an X window.

Running Test Cases
After starting xv6 in QEMU, you can run the following test cases to verify the functionality of each implemented task:

Nice Task
The combined_test verifies the implementation of the nice UNIX API, adjusting process priorities in a multi-level Round Robin Scheduler.

To run:
combined_test

Scheduler Task
The following tests validate the priority-based Round Robin Scheduler, where processes calculate prime numbers based on their priority levels. Higher-priority processes are expected to run more frequently:

To run each test case:

prime1
prime2
prime3
Extra Credit Task
These test cases demonstrate priority inversion and priority inheritance mechanisms. They create scenarios to test locking behavior with different priorities.

To run each test case:

test_lock
test_inversion
test_inheritance
